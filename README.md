##1.	Introduction
The project titled “Online Tuition Fee Payment System” is a web-based application. University has a large number of students who pay all the university fees in specific bank branches by cash deposits, electronic funds transfer or bank drafts to the university accounts. Such methods of paying fees have not been adequately effective, particularly during examination periods when most students are paying fees to meet the requirements for entering examination rooms. The process of paying fees is characterized by long queues, too much waiting by students and congestion at banks where payments are made. It was high time to develop an alternative system that enables online fees payment by students. An institute has different branches at different locations that want to control and maintain the salary of employers and student personal and payment details. The web application offers a facility to register new student information, payment details, and change student details. This helps users to pay tuition fees sitting anywhere allowing one a clear and transparent view of the cost of the course fee. By making the payment using online banking or at the local bank, 100% of the funds transferred to the university are assured and no costly bank charges are deducted which may delay the process. It's a fast and safe way to transfer the money and make payment promptly. Users will receive a notification of their payment upon receipt.
##2.	Requirement Analysis
###Scope
Online Tuition Fee Payment System is an integrated developed software that was intended to offer an extra channel for fees payment, through the development of a secure online fee payment system. The main aim of this project is to develop a web-based system that allows secure online fees payment for university. The system will be used by students and their sponsors to pay all kinds of university fees online, and by university accounts offices to verify students' payments. The system captures financial information after payments are made. 
###Objective
The Online Tuition Fee Payment System is a web-based application and maintains a centralized repository of all related information. The objective of the project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of transferring tuition fees using debit and credit cards from anywhere. We will design a system that will allow one to perform all relevant operations.

###Project Outcomes
There are some objectives or outcomes of this project. The objectives are given below 
 This system will connect user and admin directly through Internet.
 This system will provide facilities to modify and delete user’s data.
 This System will maintain & control the database of student’s information.
###Users of the system:-
o	Admin of the system:-
-	Manage account details of students-means Insert, Update or Delete student details after login
-	Search and generate report of any account.
-	Search and modify details of student.
o	Accountant of the university
-	Accountant can search for a particular student.
-	Update details of any student.
-	Enrolling new student in the system.
o	Student of the system
-	Student can pay their fees online.
-	Search history of paid fees.
##3.	Implementation Details
In this paper, we propose a new tuition fee structure. The balance can be transferred online through this system. This project is based on a client-server model in which we gave access to two users i.e. Admin, Student. Each user will have a unique identification number and password for login. The user needs to know his account number, username and password to check the balance and move the amount. In this project, we give all privileges (create, update, delete) to the admin and the user can only perform certain operations, such as checking the balance and transferring the tuition fees. To perform this operation a unique identification number and password must be used by the user to enter the system. After the transaction is completed, the screen will show a confirmation message. 

###Hardware Requirements:
-	Processor – At least 2.0GHZ
-	Ram – At least 2GB

###Software Requirements:
-	Operating System – Windows
-	Front End – PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
-	Back End – MySQL
-	Editor Tools – Sublime
-	Other Tools – Git
##4.	Conclusion
The project aimed to develop an online payment system that would alleviate the issues surrounding the current methods of paying fees at the university. This web-based system will allow students to pay their tuition fees using credit and debit cards from anywhere.
